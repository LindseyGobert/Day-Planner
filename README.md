# Day-Planner
Section 5 Homework

An html, css, and javascript file combined to create a Day Planner. 

This day planner shows the hours from 9am to 5pm. It is color coordinated so you can see exactly where you are during the day. If the time has past, the text area should be grey. The text area of the current hour should be red and the text area of the hours you have not reached should be green. 

You should be able to log information in the day planner and have it saved to the local storage.
